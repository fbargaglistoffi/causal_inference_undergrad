## Identification and Estimation  

In causal inference, identification refers to the theoretical question of whether a causal effect can be determined from the observed data and the assumptions encoded in the study design or model. It answers the question: "Can we, in principle, express the causal effect of interest as a function of the observed variables?" Identification depends on assumptions such as exchangeability (no unmeasured confounding), positivity, and consistency, and often involves tools like potential outcomes or directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). If a causal effect is not identifiable, no amount of statistical analysis will yield a valid estimate — because the data alone cannot disentangle the causal effect from bias or confounding.  

Once identification is established, the next step is estimation, which involves applying statistical methods to calculate the size of the effect using real data. Estimation uses techniques like regression, inverse probability weighting, or matching to quantify the identified causal relationship. In our simulations, for example, once we specify that the causal effect of smoking on lung cancer is identifiable by adjusting for age, we use regression to estimate that effect. If we skip the identification step and go straight to estimation without accounting for confounding or bias, our estimates may be precise — but wrong. Together, identification and estimation form the backbone of credible causal analysis: one ensures that we're asking the right question, and the other that we're answering it correctly.

## Estimation of causal effects  

Estimation of causal effects refers to the process of using statistical methods to quantify the size and direction of a causal relationship between an exposure and an outcome. Once a causal effect has been identified—meaning that, under certain assumptions, it can be expressed in terms of observed variables—estimation allows us to compute a numerical value for that effect using data. Common estimation techniques include linear regression, inverse probability weighting, and matching. The goal is not just to observe an association, but to measure how much changing the exposure would change the outcome, assuming the identification conditions are satisfied.  


## Taxonomy of estimation models  

The taxonomy of estimation models refers to the classification of different statistical approaches used to estimate causal effects based on the structure of the data and the assumptions made. Broadly, estimation models fall into categories such as outcome regression (e.g., linear or logistic regression), exposure modeling (e.g., propensity scores), and doubly robust methods that combine both. These models vary in how they handle confounding, missing data, and complexity of relationships between variables. Choosing the appropriate estimation model depends on the research question, the nature of the confounding, and how well the model's assumptions align with the underlying causal structure.
